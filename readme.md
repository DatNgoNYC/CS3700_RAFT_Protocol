Hello!

The program is organized using the state pattern design. The replica class is the "context" and it will represent each replica. Each replica has a 'state' property that represents the state it is in, Follower, Candidate, or Leader. The implementations of these classes are derived from out base class BaseRaftState to encapsulate common functionality. You'll find the code sprinkled with comments explaining its connection to raft and some js specific comments.
